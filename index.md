# Ok, Docker

Ok, Docker is a set of ready-to-use docker images built daily and automatically using travis and rocker.

All images are based on debian (either jessie or stretch) and we try to keep the size and layer count as low as possible.

# Image list

## [okdocker/nginx](/nginx): nginx with ngx_pagespeed

## [okdocker/pynode](/pynode): python 3.6 and node.js with yarn

# More informations

You can read about the [goals and methodology of this project](/philosophy).

If you think a base image you created and you use regularly would fit in this namespace, let's talk!
