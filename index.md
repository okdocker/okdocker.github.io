# Ok, Docker

Ok, Docker is a set of ready-to-use docker images built daily and automatically, meant to serve as base images for different purposes. All images are based on debian (either jessie or stretch) and we try to
keep the amount of filesystem layers as low as possible.

You can read about the [goals and methodology of this project](/philosophy).

# Image list

## [okdocker/nginx](/nginx): nginx with ngx_pagespeed

## [okdocker/pynode](/pynode): python 3.6 and node.js with yarn
